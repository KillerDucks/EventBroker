Main Requirements
    - Database API
    - Cache API
    - Stats API [Small_Modular_API]

Considerations
    MongoDB for the main database
    Redis for the main cache

Format
    We need a standard JSON response for all microservice.

    A microservice request to other microservice
    
        {
            Timestamp: Date.now(),
            Security: {
                Type: JWT | OTT [OneTimeToken] | Other,
                Key: Token | OTT | Key,
                Broker: <the microservice that was the broker of the security key>
            },
            Request: {
                ...
            }
        }

    A microservice response to other microservice

        {
            Timestamp: Date.now(),
            Security: {
                Type: JWT | OTT [OneTimeToken] | Other,
                Key: Token | OTT | Key,
                Broker: <the microservice that was the broker of the security key>
            },
            Payload: {
                Type: "response",
                Data: {
                    // The Data container houses the API specific endpoint response.
                    .....                    
                }
            }
        }

Improvements
    - Cache_class.js
        - Improve by implementing a higher level of abstraction
        - Add support for more Redis commands/features
